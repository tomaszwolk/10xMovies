### Project description
MyVOD is a web application that helps movie enthusiasts manage a personal watchlist and instantly see where those movies are available across major VOD platforms. The MVP focuses on a streamlined workflow: search IMDb-sourced movies, add up to 10 to your watchlist, track availability on Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Prime Video, and Apple TV+, mark movies as watched, and optionally generate personalized AI suggestions using Gemini.

For the full product specification, refer to the PRD: [./.ai/prd.md](./.ai/prd.md)

### Getting started locally

Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management
- Redis 7+ (for Celery)
- PostgreSQL 15 (local or a hosted instance like Supabase)
- API keys: Watchmode, TMDB, Gemini (optional for AI during MVP)

1) Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url>
cd 10xMovies
```

2) Backend setup (Django + DRF)
```bash
cd myVOD
uv sync
```

Create a `.env` file (example values shown):
```bash
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=replace-me
DEBUG=true
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Database (choose one)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/myvod
# or Supabase connection string
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname

# Redis / Celery
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
CELERY_BROKER_URL=${REDIS_URL}
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=${REDIS_URL}

# External APIs
WATCHMODE_API_KEY=your-watchmode-api-key
TMDB_API_KEY=your-tmdb-api-key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

Run the application (when the Django project scaffolding is present):
```bash
# Apply migrations
uv run python manage.py migrate

# Start the dev server
uv run python manage.py runserver 8000

# In separate terminals, start Celery worker and beat
uv run celery -A myvod worker -l info
uv run celery -A myvod beat -l info
```

3) Frontend setup (planned)

The frontend will live in `./frontend` (React + Vite). Once committed:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes
- Example environment variables are provided for local development. Adjust for your environment.
- For Docker-based workflows, Dockerfiles and compose definitions will be added in a future iteration.
