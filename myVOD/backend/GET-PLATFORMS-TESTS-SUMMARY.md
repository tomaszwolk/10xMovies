# GET /api/platforms/ - Tests Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive test suite for the GET /api/platforms/ endpoint, covering all aspects of functionality including success scenarios, error handling, and edge cases.

## Test File Location
```
myVOD/backend/myVOD/myVOD/tests/test_platforms.py
```

## Test Classes

### 1. PlatformListAPITests
Main test class for the platforms endpoint with 7 test methods.

#### Test Setup
- Creates 4 test platforms: Test Netflix, Test HBO Max, Test Disney+, Test Amazon Prime Video
- Uses `get_or_create` to avoid conflicts with existing production data
- Test platforms have "test-" prefix in slug to distinguish from real data
- Uses `setUpTestData` for efficient test data creation (runs once per class)

**Note**: Since the `Platform` model has `managed=False`, Django doesn't create a separate test database for this table. Tests work with the actual database, hence the need for unique test data.

#### Test Methods

**test_get_platforms_success**
- Verifies successful retrieval of all platforms
- Checks 200 OK status code
- Validates response is a list with at least 4 items (allows for production data)

**test_get_platforms_response_structure**
- Validates response structure matches PlatformDto specification
- Checks all required fields: id, platform_slug, platform_name
- Verifies field types (int, str, str)
- Ensures no extra fields are returned

**test_get_platforms_content**
- Verifies response contains expected test platform data
- Checks all test platform slugs are present (test-netflix, test-hbo-max, etc.)
- Checks all test platform names are correct

**test_get_platforms_ordering**
- Tests that platforms are ordered by id (ascending)
- Verifies ordering consistency

**test_get_platforms_no_authentication_required**
- Confirms endpoint is public (no authentication required)
- Makes request without credentials
- Verifies successful response

**test_get_platforms_multiple_requests**
- Tests consistency across multiple requests
- Verifies results are identical between requests
- Ensures deterministic behavior

**test_get_platforms_accepts_only_get_method**
- Verifies endpoint only accepts GET requests
- Tests POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH methods return 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED
- Ensures proper HTTP method restrictions

### 2. PlatformListEmptyDatabaseTests
Tests for database handling with existing data.

**test_get_platforms_with_existing_data**
- Verifies graceful handling of existing database content
- Should return 200 OK with list (empty or populated)
- Validates response structure is correct regardless of data count
- **Note**: Since Platform model has `managed=False`, we can't create a truly empty test database, so this test validates the endpoint works with any state

## Running Tests

### Run all platform tests
```bash
cd myVOD/backend/myVOD
python manage.py test myVOD.tests.test_platforms
```

### Run specific test class
```bash
python manage.py test myVOD.tests.test_platforms.PlatformListAPITests
```

### Run specific test method
```bash
python manage.py test myVOD.tests.test_platforms.PlatformListAPITests.test_get_platforms_success
```

### Run with verbose output
```bash
python manage.py test myVOD.tests.test_platforms --verbosity=2
```

## Test Coverage

### Scenarios Covered ✅
- ✅ Successful retrieval of platforms (200 OK)
- ✅ Response structure validation (PlatformDto)
- ✅ Content accuracy (correct platform data)
- ✅ Ordering consistency (by id)
- ✅ Public access (no authentication required)
- ✅ Multiple request consistency
- ✅ HTTP method restrictions
- ✅ Database handling with existing data

### Edge Cases ✅
- ✅ Database with existing production data (coexists with test data)
- ✅ Multiple platforms (ordered correctly)
- ✅ Requests without authentication
- ✅ Invalid HTTP methods

### Not Tested (Out of Scope)
- ❌ Database connection failures (tested via view error handling)
- ❌ Performance/load testing
- ❌ Concurrent request handling

## Expected Test Results

All tests should pass:
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 8 tests in X.XXXs

OK
```

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests should be:
1. Run automatically on every commit
2. Required to pass before merging PRs
3. Part of the deployment pipeline
4. Monitored for test execution time

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests
- When API specification changes
- When adding new platforms
- When modifying response structure
- When changing business logic

### Best Practices Followed
- ✅ Clear test names describing what is tested
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings
- ✅ Proper use of setUp/setUpTestData
- ✅ Testing one thing per test method
- ✅ Readable assertions with clear error messages
- ✅ Following AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Important Notes

### Working with `managed=False` Models
- The `Platform` model has `managed=False`, meaning Django doesn't manage the table schema
- This causes tests to run against the actual database, not a separate test database
- **Solution**: Tests use `get_or_create` with unique test slugs (prefixed with "test-")
- Test data coexists with production data without conflicts

### Test Data Management
- Test platforms use slugs: `test-netflix`, `test-hbo-max`, `test-disney-plus`, `test-amazon-prime`
- These are created once and reused across test runs
- Tests validate that these specific test platforms exist in responses
- Production data (if present) doesn't interfere with test assertions

### Best Practices Followed
- Tests use Django's APITestCase for REST framework integration
- Test data is created once per class for efficiency
- All tests are independent and can run in any order
- No external dependencies (mocks not needed for this simple endpoint)
- Unique test identifiers prevent conflicts with production data
