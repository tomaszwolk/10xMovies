## BACKEND and DATABASE

### Guidelines for SQL

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend
- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently
- Implement JSONB columns for semi-structured data instead of creating many tables for {{flexible_data}}
- Use materialized views for complex, frequently accessed read-only data
