### Guidelines for PYTHON

#### DJANGO

- Use class-based views instead of function-based views for more maintainable and reusable code components
- Implement Django REST Framework for building APIs with serializers that enforce data validation
- Use Django ORM query expressions and annotations for complex database queries involving {{data_models}}
- Leverage Django signals sparingly and document their usage to avoid hidden side effects in the application flow
- Implement custom model managers for encapsulating complex query logic rather than repeating queries across views
- Use Django forms or serializers for all user input to ensure proper validation and prevent security vulnerabilities in {{user_input_fields}}
